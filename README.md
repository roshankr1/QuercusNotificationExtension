# MyQuercusNotificationExtension

This Chrome Extension is developed to keep me updated with any new notices posted on college website. I did Web Scraping to fetch all notices from Quercus and then used a preexisting API. 

Custom CSS needs to be completed. 
JSON files are borrowed from William Wu's implementation.
